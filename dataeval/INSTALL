For testing the following line has to be added to .bashrc where MEASROOT has to
be present in your environment.

```sh
export MEASROOT=/cygdrive/c/KBData/measurement
export MEASBACKUP=c:/KBData/backup

function findmeas()
{
  find $MEASROOT -type f -name $1 | xargs cygpath -wa
}

export -f findmeas
```
