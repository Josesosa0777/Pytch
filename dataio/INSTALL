For testing the following line has to be added to .bashrc where the first 3
statement has to fit to your environment.

```sh
PATH=/cygdrive/c/Python27:$PATH

export MEASROOT=/cygdrive/c/KBData/measurement
export MEASBACKUP=c:/KBData/backup

findmeas() {
  m=`find $MEASROOT -type f -name $1`
  if [ $m ]
    then cygpath -ma $m
  fi
}

export -f findmeas
```
